## Creating a timesheet.
A time sheet is added using the `Add timesheet` button, just under your user information.

![timesheet_button](https://github.com/kakandemanwell/Tutorials/assets/66520084/ebffa5b0-1c4d-4742-9213-7a3b4fce84cd)

After the selection, an empty timesheet is created and is to be edited for submission with your information.
There are only two fields to fill.
The day worked or holiday and the time(work hours) worked for a specific day.

From the image, the input fields include the `Day worked`, all institutionally approved holidays,
including `Public holiday`, `Compassionate Leave`, `Sick Leave`, `Maternity / Partenty Leave`, `Annual Leave`
and finally `Hours` which is the total number of hours worked in the day.

Note that:
	- **All holidays are by default given 0 workhours and cannot be changed.
	- therefore, For any given `Holiday`, this field(`Hours`) is always disabled.**
	
	
## Save
The save button takes the current inputs and saves them to the database.
This is written to the current timesheets and awaits submission.
This means that a deletion of this saved information erases everything that has been created so far.

Note that: **for a timesheet to be submitted, it has to first be saved.**

	
## Clear
The clear button erases entry time inputs that you may find to be errors or wrong inputs.
This means that, unlike the delete button, the clear button only affects what has currently been
entered  & saved but has no effect on the data that has been submitted.
	
## Delete
The delete button, unlike the clear button, will erase everything in the timesheet,
including the saved state of the timesheet in the database before submission.
You have to Note that **as an employee, you can not delete a timesheet once it has been submitted.
This calls you to be cautious when using the delete button.**

Because all timesheets are submitted to a reviewer for approval, some of these may be rejected and resent back for correction if they are not satisfying managerial requirements or expectations.
Any wrong information in the timesheets will be resent back for review by your supervisors (Reviewers and Account managers).
 
## Print
You can print both saved and submitted timesheets.
Special to the printed document is the total work hours for the given period of time are included at the bottom of the document.

The `submit` button is the final step in the timesheet creation. It updates the database and sends the created document for review by designated reviewers and Key Account Managers. The same shall review your submitted document and approve the provided information.
